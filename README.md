## Description
This project creates a note taker that can be used to organize and keep track of tasks. The user is initially presented with a landing page with a option to go to the notes page, once on the notes page the user will see existing notes on the left hand column and create new notes on the right hand column. Once the user enters the title and text for a note a save icon will appear at the top of the page. When clicked the new note will be saved and added to the left hand column list of notes. The list of existing notes may be clicked on to open and view the contents of that note, there is also a delete button that can be used to remove notes no longer needed.
